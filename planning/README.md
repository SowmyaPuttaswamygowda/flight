# Flight Time Details and Information

This README provides information about the Flight Time project, including the strategy, implementation, and flight details.

## Strategy

The strategy of the Flight Time project is to provide users with accurate and up-to-date information about flight schedules, including departure and arrival times, durations, and any stops. It aims to streamline the process of planning travel by offering a user-friendly interface to access this information easily.

## Implementation

The Flight Time project is implemented using a combination of technologies, including:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The implementation involves fetching flight data based on user input, processing it to extract relevant details, and presenting it to the user in a clear and organized manner.
